Phoenix is a group project from the students of Islington College. I, being the leader of the group, guided us on how to implement the website. Phoenix is a sample e-commerce website that retails watches.

Tools used:
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The main goal of the website's design was to highlight the e-commerce platform and the ways in which technology has changed the commercial sector. With great ambition, we carried out our intentions to create a user-friendly website that would advertise timepieces from various companies.
